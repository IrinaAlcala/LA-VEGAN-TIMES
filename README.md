# LA-VEGAN-TIMES

Welcome to LA VEGAN TIMES! This app will guide you through some of the best vegan restaurants in Los Angeles!. Veganism became quite popular in the last decade and more and more people discover the benefits of plant-based diet. In my app you will get an opportunity to see the list of restaurants that have vegan food, create your own list of restaurants  you would like to visit, and and see the reviews from these restaurants. Also, as a user, you will get a chance to post your review, update it or delete. Enjoy the food!  My project Trello Box: https://trello.com/b/LeKwVLxd/my-la-vegan-times-app.
